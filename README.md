**Description**: This is a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game written as my first project.The game allows two users to compete against each other by taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. 

## Features
- Two-player functionality.
- A 3x3 grid that dynamically updates after each move.
- Automatic detection of winning conditions or a draw.
- Simple and intuitive interface for gameplay.

## How to Play
- The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their mark (Player 1 is "X", Player 2 is "O") on the grid.
- The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all grid spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries/Modules*  : IPython.display, random

## Challenges Faced
- Validating user input (e.g., ensuring players place their mark in an empty spot).
- Detecting winning conditions efficiently.
- Ensuring the game ends correctly when a winner or draw occurs.

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience (e.g., using `Tkinter` or `pygame`).
- Introduce a single-player mode where the second player is controlled by an AI.
